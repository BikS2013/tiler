  caveats <<~EOS
    First launch: open Tiler (menu bar icon, no Dock icon) and allow Accessibility:
      System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility > enable Tiler
    It is the only permission Tiler needs.

    Tile a desktop: menu bar icon > Tile This Desktop, or Ctrl+Cmd+P.
    Only that desktop on that display is tiled; everything else is left alone.

    Show every shortcut: Ctrl+Cmd+/   Settings: menu bar icon > Settings...
    Move or resize any untiled window with the keyboard: Ctrl+Cmd+M, then arrows
    (Shift resizes, Option = fine, C centre, M fill, Return done).
    Move the focused window to the previous / next desktop: Ctrl+Cmd+, / Ctrl+Cmd+.
    (keep Mission Control "Move left/right a space" shortcuts turned on).
    Focus follows mouse (optional): menu bar icon > Focus Follows Mouse.
    Upgrading: Settings > General > Add Missing Settings (adds new settings only).
    Launch at login: Settings > General.
